              <h2>About Mahmood Magic</h2>
              <p>
                 
                Mahmood Magic are two brothers who have, through the deserts of Arabia to the ruins of Matchu Piccu in Peru and to the wonders of the Great Wall of China, learned the secrets to the art of mentalism and magic. Rather than using elaborate objects, sets, and machines, they bring a <span class="bold">simpler touch to magic </span>that has rarely been seen before.
